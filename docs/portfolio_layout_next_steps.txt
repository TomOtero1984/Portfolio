Portfolio Layout Fixes – Next Steps (Mobile-Focused)

1. Footer – Mobile Layout Adjustment
   - Issue: Footer breaks or appears misaligned on small viewports.
   - Fix: Switch to vertical column layout below mobile breakpoint.
     Use flex-col or grid structure for better flow on narrow screens.

2. Navbar – Responsive Compression
   - Issue: Name/title area gets squished on mobile.
   - Fix: Add hamburger menu or dropdown nav for mobile view.
     Consider shortening the header title or using initials.

3. GitHub Link – Footer Enhancement (Low Priority)
   - Note: Already listed on resume; not urgent.
   - Suggestion: Add GitHub icon/link to the footer during next revision.

Suggested Immediate Actions:
- Add mobile breakpoint styles (e.g., @media (max-width: 768px))
- Update footer layout to use stacked elements in mobile view
- Add menu toggle logic for responsive navbar
- Optionally, add GitHub icon using a modern icon library (Heroicons, Font Awesome, etc.)
