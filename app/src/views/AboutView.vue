          Hi! I'm <strong>Tom Otero</strong>, a Build & Release Engineer based in Brooklyn, NY. Iâ€™m passionate about automating developer workflows, scaling CI/CD infrastructure, and improving engineering productivity across diverse teams and industries.
        </p>
        <p>
          My experience spans fintech, gaming, and open source. At Rockstar Games, I manage asset-driven CI/CD pipelines for both Windows and Linux, lead infrastructure upgrades, transform legacy processes into reusable automation, and champion containerization with Docker for reliable deployments. I collaborate closely with QA, developers, and release managers to deliver stable builds quickly and efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously, I worked at Novus Labs (contracted to Cruise), where I built automated pipelines in Jenkins and Buildkite, developed Python test automation for embedded Linux systems, and maintained artifact management using JFrog Artifactory. Across every environment, I focus on reproducibility, testability, and enabling teams to ship with confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Iâ€™m passionate about developer experience, CI/CD best practices, and helping teams modernize their workflowsâ€”whether for games, cloud-native services, or enterprise apps.
        </p>
