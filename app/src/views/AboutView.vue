          Hi! I'm <strong>Tom Otero</strong>, a Build & Release Engineer with a background in embedded systems and mechanical engineering. I specialize in automating developer workflows, scaling CI/CD infrastructure, and supporting teams across gaming, embedded hardware, and Linux-based systems. Based in Brooklyn, NY, Iâ€™ve worked in both high-velocity environments and deeply technical domains, always focused on making builds reproducible, deployments reliable, and engineering smoother for everyone involved.
        </p>

        <p>
          At <strong>Rockstar Games</strong>, I maintain and extend TeamCity-driven CI/CD pipelines supporting a broad set of internal tools and developer workflows. My work includes deploying assets across isolated networks via SSH and rsync, managing Perforce/Git integrations, and supporting Windows and Linux infrastructure. Iâ€™ve replaced legacy servers, migrated systems to WSL2-backed environments, and documented build and release processes to make onboarding and incident resolution easier for the whole team. When things go sideways, I coordinate with developers, QA, project leads, and NOC to keep builds moving and unblock teams during high-stakes releases.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before that, I worked at <strong>Novus Labs</strong>, first as a mechanical engineer, then as an embedded systems test engineer on the Cruise GM contract. My mechanical work included designing RF testbeds for Alexa Bluetooth Mesh certification and building firmware-synchronized microcontroller systems using ATmega328P. I wrote automation scripts in Python and Bash to control USB-over-SSH devices, Telnet power switches, and voice-triggered test scenarios using sox and Google TTS. Later, I transitioned to embedded Linux validationâ€”developing Pytest frameworks for low-level drivers, building latency-sensitive test harnesses with Raspberry Pi and Arduino, and managing nightly CI pipelines using Jenkins and Buildkite. I delivered reproducible test logs, regression data, and system-level benchmarks that helped firmware teams move faster and break less.
        </p>

        <p>
          Across every role, my focus is on improving reliability, maintainability, and team productivityâ€”whether that means refactoring flaky pipelines, automating a testbed, or helping devs understand their build failures. I work best when I can be hands-on with both the system and the people using it, bridging gaps between engineering layers to keep teams moving.
        </p>

        <p>
          Iâ€™m currently open to new roles in build systems, infrastructure engineering, or embedded toolchainsâ€”especially in industries where reliability and iteration speed both matter. If you're solving interesting problems at scale and need someone to help your developers move faster without breaking things, Iâ€™d love to talk.
        </p>
