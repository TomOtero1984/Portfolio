<think>Ok, let's figure this out:

I'm being asked to convert the provided text into HTML format. Let me examine the content and create an appropriate structure for the conversion.

The content appears to be a resume or CV for Thomas Otero, including sections like Summary, Experience, Skills, and Education. I should aim to create clean, semantic HTML that accurately represents this information while making it visually appealing.

Here's how I plan to approach the conversion:
1. Use appropriate HTML tags for structure (header, section, article, etc.)
2. Create headings for each major section
3. Format text with proper styling (using CSS or embedded styles)
4. Add visual separators between sections
5. Highlight key skills and experiences
6. Ensure a modern, clean design

Let me now create the HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
